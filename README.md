# K-fold-cross-validated-classification
## Machine Learning Model

The "ML Code.ipynb" Python notebook contains a machine learning model designed for distinguishing between synthetic patient data for Influenza and COVID-19 infections. 
For evaluating the model's predictive capability through the area under the ROC curve, the "AUC.ipynb" notebook should be executed.
